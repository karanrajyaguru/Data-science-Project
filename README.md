# Data-science-Project


Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Use this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next.We have given you two datasets , hr_train.csv and hr_test.csv . You need to use data hr_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘left’. hr_test data contains all other factors except “left”, you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.
You have to submit the probability scores, not the hard classes
